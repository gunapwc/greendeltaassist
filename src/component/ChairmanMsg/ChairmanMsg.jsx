            <p>
The Pharmacy division of Aster DM Healthcare has grown exponentially, going beyond boundaries, both in products & geographies, in the recent years. The brand is respected & trusted by the residents & expatriates, due to innovative ideas & efficient service by a passionate team.</p>
<p>
The Vision of Aster Retail is to be a prominent global brand in the long term & this is possible with the momentum created. I hope that Aster Pharmacy will soon become a synonym for medicines & related products in the GCC.</p>
